\section*{Artifacts}\label{s:artifact-appendix}

Based on the standard Artifact Appendix template used by the USENIX Security
Symposium. Please follow the self-contained instructions below and assume
(i)~you are compiling the final version of the Artifact Appendix (no need to
cater to reviewers, but to general users of your artifact) and (ii)~you are
documenting everything in scope for all the artifact evaluation badges
(\emph{Artifacts Available}, \emph{Artifacts Functional}, \emph{Results
Reproduced}). More information at~\cite{secartifacts}.
